/*
 Fade

 This code shows how to fade an LED on pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11,
 using the analogWrite() function.
 Written for emulating aircraft warning lamp systems on model Bridges, Spans, Towers, Antennas, etc.

  // the setup routine runs once when you press reset:

  pinMode(led3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led4, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led5, OUTPUT);

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:

void loop()  {
  // set the brightness of all pins:

  analogWrite(led0, brightness);
  analogWrite(led1, brightness);
  analogWrite(led2, brightness);
  analogWrite(led3, brightness);
  analogWrite(led4, brightness);
  analogWrite(led5, brightness);

  // change the brightness for next time through the loop:

  brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;

  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:

  if (brightness == 0 || brightness == 255) {
    fadeAmount = -fadeAmount ;
  }

  // wait for 35 milliseconds to see the dimming effect:

  delay(35);
